- 🛠️ Technologies that interest me : High end computer components, mathematical research, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, GPU.
- 🐧 Current setup : I am currently running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.

## Most proud-of projects

Here are some projects I contributed to or did by myself :

- [Optimal allocation of bacterial resources in a bioreactor](https://github.com/pns-mam/batch) - Solving an Optimal Control Problem in Julia on maximising the volume of a bacteria.
- [Lotka-Volterra models](https://github.com/nathanedr/LotkaVolterraPreyPredator) - Prey-predator model proposed by Lotka-Volterra in 1925-1926 implemented in Python.
- [Compression Image with DCT2](https://github.com/nathanedr/CompressionImageDCT2) - A python code that is compressing images using the DCT2 method.
- [Reinforcement Learning for the game 2048](https://github.com/nathanedr/PER_2048_PNS) - Reinforcement Learning project to win at the game 2048 using Value Iteration and Temporal Differencing Learning with N-Tuple Networks agents.
