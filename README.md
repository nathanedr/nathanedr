# Welcome to my GitHub page ! 👋

Hi, I'm Nathan Edery, an Engineering graduate from [Polytech Nice Sophia Antipolis](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr/), with a major in [Applied Mathematics and Modeling](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/formation/offre-de-formation/ingenieur-mathematiques-appliquees-et-modelisation) and a specialization in Data Science. I enjoy working on real-life problems—especially optimization (maximizing/minimizing things to make systems work better)—and Deep Learning projects such as image recognition or Reinforcement Learning.
