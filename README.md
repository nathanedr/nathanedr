# Welcome to my GitHub page ! 👋

Hi, I'm Nathan Edery, currently in my fifth and last year at [Polytech Nice Sophia Antipolis](https://polytech.univ-cotedazur.fr/), majoring in [applied mathematics and modeling specialisation](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/formation/offre-de-formation/ingenieur-mathematiques-appliquees-et-modelisation), specialized in Data Science. I mainly like to work on real-life problems such as maximising or minimising things to make other work or on Deep Learning projects like image recognition or Reinforcement Learning.

   - SQL
   - Matlab
- 🛠️ Technologies that interest me : High end computer components, mathematical research, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, GPU.
- 🐧 Current setup : I am currently running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.

## Most proud-of projects

Here are some projects I contributed to or did by myself :

- [Optimal allocation of bacterial resources in a bioreactor](https://github.com/pns-mam/batch) - Solving an Optimal Control Problem in Julia on maximising the volume of a bacteria.
- [Lotka-Volterra models](https://github.com/laitlito/LotkaVolterraPreyPredator) - Prey-predator model proposed by Lotka-Volterra in 1925-1926 implemented in Python.
- [Simple image processing software](https://github.com/laitlito/TraitementImage) - A java code to apply transformations on images such as convolution matrices for example.

Please feel free to see [my portfolio](yet_to_be_done) to discover all my projects.
